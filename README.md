# Dormouse

Dormouse is a stupidly simple tool, that builds and runs a simple CLI that wraps
existing tools and scripts based on a YAML configuration file. Originally
designed to work together with shell aliases, but can be used for all sorts of
things.

# Usage

Put a YAML file anywhere on your system, and point dormouse to it to execute
whatever command or script you have configured in the file. In the config, you
can specify either `exec` to execute a binary file with a list of arguments, or
`script`, to evaluate a shell script. Additional command line arguments are
either appended to the exec argument list, or passed as parameters to the shell
script. For example, the following configurations would be equivalent:

```yaml
---
script: |
  echo "$@"

---
exec: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "echo $@", "--"]

---
exec: ["echo"]

```

All would produce the same result:

```bash
$ dormouse config.yaml foo bar
foo bar
```

You can also require option flags and positional arguments. The `exec` and
`script` fields will be templated, and you can insert the option and argument
values via the `option` and `arg` template functions. For example:

```yaml
---
arguments:
  - name: firstname

options:
  - name: time
    short: t
    default: day

exec: ["echo", "Good {{ time }}, {{ firstname }}!"]
```

```bash
$ dormouse config.yaml Steve
Good day, Steve!

$ dormouse config.yaml Steve --time=morning
Good morning, Steve!

$ dormouse config.yaml Steve -t evening
Good evening, Steve!
```

You can create a whole command tree by adding subcommands. Each command config
can have a `subcommands` field, which is a map from command names to a new
command config. Which in turn may have it's own subcommands and so on.

```yaml
---
subcommands:
  everyone:
    exec: ["echo", "Hello everyone!"]
```

```bash
$ dormouse config.yaml everyone
Hello everyone!
```

To wrap things up, we now save our config somewhere useful and set up a shell
alias for it, and suddenly we have our very own CLI, without a single line of code:

```bash
$ alias greet="dormouse ~/.dormouse/greet.yaml"

$ greet Steve
Good day, Steve!

$ greet everyone
Hello everyone!
```
